CRUD APP - PHP + MYSQL

In this app you can add, remove, edit and see lists and their values from database.
- For styling purposes I used pure CSS.
- The all needed informations about each of list will be displayed in the table.
- For editting values related to list I used passing variables through the URL to pass id
- Your data will be stored in MySQL database

How to search interested, relative to list values?
In search input enter id of list, which is available to get below search input.
